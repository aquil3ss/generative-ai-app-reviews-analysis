Thank you for your feedback.
If the app asks you for a password it means that you have set up a password. When you set up a password you can also set a recovery email address for situations when you don't remember your password.  If you didn't provide an email address we cannot reset your password.

Thank you for your kind words. Related to this issue, we believe that the Android system is resetting the app. This happens when you have a lot of apps running in the background. The system tries to allocate memory for the active apps and closes the background apps.
If the issue persist please contact support.
